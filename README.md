## Game Description
My FOODman game is based off of the classic game called Hangman, that many of us played growing up! Once, I did some research on the original Hangman game, I noticed that due to the game's offensive nature, it has now been rebranded and changed to something called “Spaceman". Nonetheless FOODman is a fun and straight forward game to play!

It starts off by displaying boxes at the bottom of the page. These boxes will corresponds to the amount letters that make up the kitchen based mystery word that you are trying to solve for. You start by guessing one letter at a time that you think is in the mystery word, by clicking the buttons on the right hand side. If your guess is correct then the letter will appear in the box(es), but if you guess incorrectly then a part of “FOODman” appears!
Then, you take another turn and click on another letter. The more mistakes you get the more he shows up, one part at a time. You are allowed up to 4 mistakes (legs, body, arms, head) before he fully shows up and the game is over! But if you're able to guess the correct word before he shows up, you win!
